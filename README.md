# Hungarian Dictionary for Macos's Dictionary

Note: [OG guide](https://best-mac-tips.com/2021/05/16/install-custom-dictionaries-on-macos/)
The related dictionary from the [osx-dictionary](https://github.com/afischer/osx-dictionaries/tree/master/hungarian). The easiest way to do this is to use [DownGit](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home), or visit this prepared [link](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https:%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fafischer%2Fosx-dictionaries%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fhungarian).
I suggest using these zips that I created.

1. Open Dictionary
2. File > `Open Dictionaries folder`
3. UnCompress `.zip` files. This collection of files was from the `osx-dictionaries` repository, but it took much time to get only Hungarian ones.
4. Copy each `.dictionary` folder under your `/Users/<user>/Library/Dictionaries`
5. Go to `Preferences/Settings` (command + ,)
6. Enable the Hungarian dictionaries. Enjoy. (〜￣U￣)〜♫♩♪ヽ(ᐖヽ*)♬
